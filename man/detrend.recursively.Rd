\title{Detrending the data recursively}
\usage{
detrend.recursively(y, x, c, gamma, trim)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{The dependent (LHS) variable.}

\item{x}{The matrix of explanatory (RHS) variables.}

\item{c}{A filtration parameter used to construct an autocorrelation
coefficient.}

\item{gamma}{A detrending type selection parameter. If 0 the OLS detrending
is applied, if 1 the GLS detrending is applied, otherwise the autocorrelation
coefficient is calculated as \eqn{1 + c^{\gamma} T^{-\gamma}}.}

\item{trim}{The trimming parameter. It's used to find the minimum size of
subsamples while calculating recursive estimates. The ending point of the
subsample for the \eqn{t} is \eqn{max(t, trim \times T)}.}
}
\value{
A detrended series.
}
\description{
This procedure is aimed to provide a recursively detrended series. More or
less classical approach of full-sample detrending may lead to the regressors
correlated with the error term.
}
\details{
Elliott et al (1996) recommend using \eqn{c = -7} for the model with only
an intercept, and \eqn{c = -13.5} for the model with a linear trend.
