\usage{
coint.test.GH(
  ...,
  shift = "level",
  trim = 0.15,
  max.lag = 10,
  criterion = "aic",

\arguments{
\item{...}{Variables of interest.}

\item{shift}{Expected break type.}

\item{trim}{The trimming parameter to calculate break moment bounds.}

\item{max.lag}{The maximum number of lags for the internal ADF testing.}

\item{criterion}{The criterion for lag selection.}

\item{add.criticals}{Whether critical values are to be returned.
This argument is needed to suppress the calculation of critical values
during the precalculation of tables needed for the p-values estimating.}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{cointGH}. It's a list of
\itemize{
\item \code{shift}: shift type,
\item \code{Za}: \eqn{MZ_\alpha} statistic and c.v.,
\item \code{Zt}: \eqn{MZ_t} statistic and c.v.,
\item \code{ADF}: \eqn{ADF} statistic and c.v..

\description{
Gregory and Hansen (1996) test for the null hypothesis of no cointegration
under a possible structural break at the unknown moment of time.

The authors proposed ADF- and Z-type tests, slightly modified to allow
the presence of a possible regime shift. Three type of shifts are allowed:
\itemize{
\item a shift in the constant,
\item a shift in the constand with the trend included,
\item and a shift in the constant and the cointegrating vector.}

Critical values are calculated via the adopted MacKinnon procedure of
estimating the model for the response surface.
